This module depends on all the pieces of Tryton, GNU Health and the 
health_jamaica projects that make an instance of **Jamaica ePAS** for
usage within a health-centre context. It does not contain any of the 
features typically needed in a hospital. Nor does it include any 
inpatient functionality.
