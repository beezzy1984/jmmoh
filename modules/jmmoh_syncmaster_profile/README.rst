This module depends on all the pieces of Tryton, GNU Health and the 
health_jamaica projects that make an instance of **Jamaica ePAS** for
usage in an instance that will receive syncrhonisation messages from
instances in hospital or health centre.

It is expected that this module will be installed in the MOH and in the
regional and possibly parish offices.
